pest
====

Shell pipelines are pretty useful. And if you want to have multiple
outputs from one producer you can redirect its output to a temporary
file and use multiple tail -f processes to pipe to multiple consumers.

But if the temporary file is bigger than your available space you are
out of luck. This tool solves that use case.

It also is arguably more convenient (provided you already have redis
running for other purposes).

Usage
-----

redis-server needs to running and listening to its standard port.

Now you do something like this:

	$ something_with_a_lot_of_output | pest | some_work_with_output

and in another terminal:

	$ pest | some_other_work_with_output

Requirements
------------

* redis-server (https://github.com/antirez/redis)
* Redis.pm (https://github.com/melo/perl-redis)
